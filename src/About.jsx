        In my previous work experience, I interned with HNG where I gained
        practical experience in software development and project management. I
        was responsible for writing code for various projects and collaborating
        with a team to ensure that projects were completed on time and to the
        highest quality.

        I am very interested in pursuing a career in the technology industry and
        am excited to continue learning and growing as a professional. I am a
        proactive and detail-oriented individual, with excellent problem-solving
        and communication skills. I am confident that my education, experience,
        and skills make me well-suited for a career in the technology industry,
